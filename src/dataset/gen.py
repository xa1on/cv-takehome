Generate architectural datasets for symbol detection

TODO:
1. grab images from architectural pdfs
2. add symbols randomly to architectural pdfs, resembling real architectural documents.
    - hough line transform to detect walls/pipes.
    - strategically place T symbols (thermostats) along walls
    - place bowties (valves??) on pipelines
    - Keynotes: probably just good to put them randomly
3. Generate in YOLO format
